# OsuStats
literally just profile stats
seemed cool to do so i did it
nothing else really other than splitting the commands, but i think its alright for now
one problem tho, cant do names with spaces, need to somehow do a discord bot arg with spaces
was too lazy bc i spent all my time trying to auto refresh the tokens
